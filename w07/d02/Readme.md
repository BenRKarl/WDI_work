###A jQuery Drill

***Spec:***:

1.  Use `jQuery` to pull out the contents of an `input field` and display them in an `h1` on the DOM.
2.  Make the `font-size` of the `h1` proportional to the length of the string contained within it.

```html
	/*Put this in your <head> tag to include jquery into a project*/
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Potentially useful methods within jQuery for solving this problem:
- [.keyup()](http://api.jquery.com/keyup/)
- [.on()](http://api.jquery.com/on/)
- [.css()](http://api.jquery.com/on/)
