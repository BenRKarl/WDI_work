###***Anagram Detector***
######***Key Skills:*** Solving Code Challenges

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct one(s).

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `["enlists", "google", "inlets", "banana"]` the program should return "inlets".

How can we check to see if they have exactly the same letters?
