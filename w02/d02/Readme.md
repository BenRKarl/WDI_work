###***Anagram Detector***
######***Key Skills:*** Solving Code Challenges

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct one(s).

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `["enlists", "google", "inlets", "banana"]` the program should return "inlets".


What makes something an anagram? The two words have the same letters...
How can we check to see if they have exactly the same letters?

######***Key Skills:*** Sinatra, Custom Class Definitions, Faker, RTFM

###Phase 1: 
* In a `person.rb` file, define a `Person` class.  
	* An instance of the class should be initialized with two instance variables, name and email, both set using the `Faker` gem.  
	* Take a look at the Faker documentation to determine how to generate an email.
	
###Phase 2:
* In an `app.rb` file, write a `Sinatra` application.  
	* An HTTP `GET` request to '/person' should: 
		* Create a new person
		* Render that person's name and email attributes to the page
