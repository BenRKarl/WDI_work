# Morning Exercise

###***Proto Sinatra***
######***Key Skills:*** Working with Hashes, Class Definitions, View Iteration

###Part 1
- Make a hash of names
 - The key should be their initials as a symbol
	- :mm for Matt Marcello
- The value should be an array for [first_name, last_name]
	- ['Matt', 'Marcello']
ALL of these names should be in your hash:

```ruby 

proto = ['Jeff Winkler','John Murphy','Nessa Nguyen','Jeff Drakos','Rebecca Strong','Gardner Lonsberry' ,'Jonathan Gean','Nathaniel Tuvera','Tim Hannes','Aziz Hasanov','Chris Heuberger','Dmitry Shamis' ,'Corey Leveen','Paul Hiam','Steven Doran','Ben Karl','Kristen Tonga','Wake Lankard','Carlos Pichardo' ,'Paul Gasberra','Andrea Trapp','Adam Schneider','Heidi Williams-Foy'
]
```

###Part 2
- Create a Developer class with the attributes name, initials, and tagline (generated with faker.)
	- Give the class a to_s method
- Create instances of the class for each member of the...class.  Be sure to store all instances in a single array.  

###Part 3
- Using Sinatra and erb, write the absolute minimum amount of code we can use to display our array of people objects to a table, with each of their attributes.  If you are unfamiliar with how to create a table in HTML, Read the Friendly Manual (RTFM).

***challenge:*** Sort the developers alphabetically by last name.
