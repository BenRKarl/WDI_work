<!-- Build a Sinatra application
Include:
app.rb
Gemfile
views/layout.erb
views/index.erb
public/styles.css
Set up a welcome page
Display "Welcome to WDI Stocks" when there is GET request to /
 -->

<!-- Define a method that makes a request to the YahooFinance api via the YahooFinance gem.
 -->This method should take, as paramater, a stock ticker
This method should return data about the stock
Test this method manually in pry
Display, for example, google's stock price when there is GET request to /stocks/goog
The file should be show.erb
Modifying what you have created already, display a form when there is GET request to /
The form should allow a user to enter a stock ticker
On submit, the form should post to /stocks
Given an input ticker, Sinatra should then redirect to /stocks/:ticker
Style!
