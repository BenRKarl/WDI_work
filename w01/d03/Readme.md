### ***Air Conditioning***
- This should be done in a new file called `air_conditioning.rb`
- Ask the user what the current temperature is, if the A/C is functional, and what temperature they wish it was.
- If the airconditioner is functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Turn on the A/C Please"
- If the airconditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C now!  It's hot!"
- If the airconditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is below the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C whenever you have the chance...  It's cool..."
