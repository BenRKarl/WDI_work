	- The volume of their amplifier volume
	- Whether or not that want to push it over the cliff

- Then handle some conditional logic: 
	- If volume is less than 11 and they have a desire to push it over the cliff, print a message: "Crank it to eleven"
	- If volume is less than 11 and they don't want to push it over the cliff, insult their feeble propensity for rock: "That's not very rock, man."
	- If volume is greater than or equal to 11, tell them to crank it one level higher.
