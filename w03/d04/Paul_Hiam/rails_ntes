after making new rails app
go in it and 
-- make the database

$ rake db:create

then
--migrate database (Set up schema)
-- write migrations with:

$ rails g migration create_kittens_table
  * if migration file has name '_table' then remove that
OR
EVEN BETTER! DO
$ rails g model Kitten width:integer height:integer url:string
## this will make the migration file and generate the model

then run migrations with:
rake db:migrate

** you can type rails console inside your project to get irb session in your project with database linked
  Kitten.all should work (empty array)

then seed your database in seeds.rb
ex:
#for just 100 after each run of seed file (rake db:seed) put deleteall

Kitten.delete_all
-100.times do
  width = rand(100..600)
  height = rand(100..600)
  url = "http://placekitten.com/#{width}/#{height}"
  Kitten.create(width: width, height: height, url: url)
end

then

handle requests:
routes.rb
go into app ex: KittensIntroApp::Application.routes.draw do
  
  get '/' => 'kittens#index'  #map req' to 'controller#action'
  get '/' => 'kittens#index'

then make controller in controller folder ex: 'kittens_controller.rb'
  in that make the class:
  class KittensController < ApplicationController
#add the index action
  def index
    @kittens = Kitten.all
  end
  end

then make the view index in folder kittens in views
filename = index.html.erb

then fire up rails server and go to the index page. WOW
