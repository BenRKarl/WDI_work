Notes for how i set up my database and tables

CREATE DATABASE wdi_caws_app;

\c wdi_caws_app;

CREATE TABLE users
(
  id serial4 PRIMARY KEY,
  username varchar(255)
)

CREATE TABLE caws #caws needs to be the plural ofmodel file.
(
 id serial4 PRIMARY KEY,
 message varchar(255),
 user_id integer     #one to many association: thing that is
 );               owned maintains which user owns it by
               storing the user_id inside itself. EX.)dog has owner on it's collar tag.
