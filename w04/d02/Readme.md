### Rails + Zodiac 
![](INSTRUCTORS/capricorn.png)


- Create a Rails app 
- Using the Zodiac gem, create a Proto model. 
	- A proto should have a `name` (a string)
	- A proto should have a `birthday` (a date)
	- A proto shold have a `zodiac_sign`. (a string)
		- Refer to the Zodiac gem documentation to figure out how to derive a sign from a birthday.  
- Migrate your database
- Write code to seed your database with all the Protos
- A GET request to '/' should show all Protos in a table.
- ***frontend challenge***: Color each row differentially, according to zodiac sign.
