HOW TO  ADD BACKBONE APP TO RAILS -

- change 'exception' to 'null_session' in Application Controller

- Add 'index URL  to Collection'

- Add collection.fetch(); in app.js (here the collection is called monkeys, so 'monkey.fetch();')

- Change collection.add to collection.save in app.js (where you are adding a monkey to the collection)

- Add model.save underneath model.set in Model View.
