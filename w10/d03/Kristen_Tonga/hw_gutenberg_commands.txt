GROUP BY:
1. top 20, group count of books by author_id, order by count descending

2. number of authors grouped by first letter of name

3. top 20 authors grouped by book count in descending order
  ***** This is better. It explains the top three. ******
   SELECT a.name, COUNT(b.*) FROM books AS b INNER JOIN authors AS a ON a.id = b.author_id GROUP BY a.name, b.author_id ORDER BY COUNT(b.*) DESC LIMIT 20;
