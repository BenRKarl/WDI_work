##HTML Tag Scanner

In a file, `tag_scanner.rb`

* Write an html_tags method in ruby.  It should take a string of html and return an array of unique html tags contained within that string.

	- Given:`"<div class='three columns offset-by-two'><br/><ul id='contacts-links-documents'>"`
	- Return:`["div", "br", "ul"]`


*  Use HTTParty to pull HTML from a URI and then scan it for tags using your method.
