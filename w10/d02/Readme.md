####Part 1

In ***Ruby***, write a method `find_substring` that takes a `string` and a `substring` as its arguments.  If the substring is contained within the string, the method should return an index corresponding to the position of the substring inside of the string.  Otherwise, it should return false. For example:
```ruby

find_substring("groovy", "oo")
=> 2

find_substring("far out", "ar")
=> 1

find_substring("purple pie pete", "pumpkin")
=> false


```

##You are not allowed to use any methods bearing the word 'index'

####Part 2

In ***JavaScript***, write the same method.

##Customer:
- "You know those street side book selling people?  That me.  I want a way to manage what books are on my table.  Just a display of authors and books is the end goal.  I choose different books everyday for the table... so... nothing needs to be persisted!  I'll just enter the authors and books each day.  ... At first... just let me enter author names.  I wants to see the authors on the screen after entering a name."

###Stage 1
- Build a backbone application scaffold from scratch
  - Be reminded of load order
  - What is a hard dependency?  How does this affect buiding your scaffold?
