Project 1 Retrospective.

At the end of this first project I feel pretty good about what I've accomplished. Physically I'm also feeling OK, though I sometimes feel like I am fighting off a cold. I've started walking during lunches. I set a timer to 20 minutes walk in one direction and then go back to GA.  I think this has been good for self esteem and mental state.

I'm actually a little disappointed that we're being asked to put the computers away for the long weekend. But I also understand the need not to burn out. If you gave me tomorrow off and said we start a new project Monday I'd be OK with that, in fact I'd think it was a good thing. I need to take a day to recover. But I'm also excited to continue to expand my skill set.

Thursday
- This day seems like ages ago. I'm not even sure if we started then. My git repo might tell me, but I've been horrible at commits.

Friday
- Again, I'm not sure what happened here. I know that we added sessions at one point. This may have been the day. I needed sessions for the project I had in mind and was happy to get it. I was a bit concerned however when I realized that I needed two of them.

Saturday
- I went into the Library after brunch on Saturday. I was able to ponder over my code. I remember watching Ben work on his paths. But my main goal was to get Geocoder working. I had some success in this. Though I wouldn't get it fully running until much later. But once I could enter an address and get a distance I was able to go home. I put my bedframe together as it was in pieces from the move. Then I watched Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Trollhunter while rolling change. Pretty relaxing.

Sunday
- Sunday I got up early to do laundry. I took my laptop to the laundry mat but there was no wifi. I tried a few things locally, but eventually decided to put it down. The rest of the day was spent doing chores, cleaned the stove, fixed the grandfather clock moved some things around. Eventually I had an afternoon drinks and made pizza with a friend. I woke up on Monday just a tiny bit abashed at my lack of effort, but ready to go.

Monday
- Monday I found the one-on-ones with Aldric very helpful when it came to overcoming obstacles. But I began to serious examine my process. I feel like I am a little too quick to give up on problems. I'm torn on this issue, because my strategy has been if I run into a problem I give it some time and then move to another part of the project that I'm not blocked on. This let me build out structure for things, and then I could return to the blockers when I was done with that section, hit another block, or when help arrived.

When help did arrive, I invariable felt a little abashed. There was a comma missing, or a line that I felt like I should've known. I think asking is the quickest way to get a problem solved, but I also think I need to develop a stronger sense of self reliance. I don't want to be dragging my peers down with silly requests but I also want to maintain momentum and avoid despair. I cut out at 9:00 PM to watch the playoffs. Go Thunder!

Tuesday
- Tuesday I was able to get more help. I spent a good part of this day sketching out the data structure and how I wanted the join table to work. My major issue this day was passing params from page to page. Marco finally bailed me out later, but I still needed those params on another page and had no way to pass them. It wasn't until about 10:00PM when I figured out the hidden fields in the form and how to pass them. That was a victory, whoop-whoop moment. I saw a lot of pry magic happening when I got help. I have to get better at diagnostic coding. I'm also a ham at psql. I know we've been through this stuff and beat myself up for not just knowing it. It's something I'd like to work on more. Both pry and psql, and the finer points of terminal.

Wednesday
- I had so much to do on Wednesday. There was tables that needed to appear, data structures that needed to work, and logic to build concerning checking items in. Somehow I got through a lot of it. I still dropped certain functionality in order to make progress. For example I didn't filter Checkers by distance, which I need to do. But I turned my attention to CSS for most of the second half of the day. Skeleton was helpful. I worked until 9:00PM and then booked it to watch the Playoffs again. After the soul-crushing loss, I went home and made sure that Heroku was up and running and refined some of the logic.

I had some trouble settling down to sleep. I think I've been over-stimulated. But I can say my deformed baby has come lurching into life and I was as ready to show it as I was going to get. Keeping in mind that the goal was to accept the project regardless of its state. I thought it was worth accepting.
